  "readme": "# BackboneIO\n\nThis module allow you to reuse the same _Backbone.js_ model between the client and the server (_Node.js_) and synchronize them with _socket.io_.\nThis solution is built on top of _Backbone.iobind_ (http://alogicalparadox.com/backbone.iobind/).\n_BackboneIO_ extend the _Backbone_ module and provide a _BackboneIO.sync_ function that communicate with _socket.io_ instead of using HTTP methods.\nThe _BackboneIO.Model_ has default functions to _update_ or _delete_ a _Model_.\nThe _BackboneIO.Collection_ has default functions to _create_ a _Model_ or _read_ a _Collection_.\n\n## Install\n\nFor the server just type :\n```\nnpm install backboneio\n```\nor via git repository :\n```\nnpm install git://github.com/MiLk/backboneio.git\n```\n\nFor the client you need to copy the files _backbone.js_ and _backboneio.js_ in your javascript directory.\nThen put this code in your HTML :\n```html\n<script src=\"/js/backbone.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/js/backboneio.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Use\n\nA basic example is available in sample directory.\n\n## Thanks\n\n* Jake Luer [[Github: @logicalparadox](http://github.com/logicalparadox)] [[Twitter: @jakeluer](http://twitter.com/jakeluer)] [[Website](http://alogicalparadox.com)]\n\n## LICENSE\n\nNew BSD License\n\nCopyright (c) 2012, Emilien Kenler hello@emilienkenler.com\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    * Neither the name of the <organization> nor the\n      names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products\n      derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.
